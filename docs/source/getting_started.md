# Getting Started

```{toctree}
:hidden:

gs_codespaces

```

To get started with this course, you will:

1. Create an account on [Github](https://github.com).
2. Tell us your Github name so we can track your progress.
3. Make a copy of the source code repository for the course.
4. Start the web-based programming editor to begin the course. 

## 1: Get a Github Account

Github is a professional source code repository, and almost everything you do at
the League will involve Github, so let's start with creating a Github account. 

<a href="https://github.com/signup" target="_blank">Create an Account at Github</a>

If you already have an account, sign into it now. 

## 2: Tell Us Your Github Name

Let us know your Github name so we can track your progress by filling out and submitting this form:

<iframe src="/forms/github.html" width="600" height="250" frameborder="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0">Loading…</iframe>

If you aren't a League student you can skip it, but we'd still love to know who you are. 

## 3: Get the Source Code

Click this button to "fork" the source code:

<div class="centered">
<span class="button green"><a href="https://github.com/league-curriculum/Python-Apprentice/fork" target="_blank" >
<img src="https://images.jointheleague.org/p3logos/github-mark-white.png" alt="Fork Repository">
Fork Repository</a></span>
</div>
<br/>
Then, on the next page,   click on the 
<img class="inline" src="https://images.jointheleague.org/github/create_fork.png"> button. 
This will copy the whole course into your Github account. 

When the fork is finished, you can start your web based programming editor. 

( If you are more currious, you can [visit the course repository](https://github.com/league-curriculum/Python-Apprentice), and then fork from there. )

## 4: Start the Codespace

### Enable progress reporting
 After the code is forked, you wil see the web page for the course repository,
named 'Python-Apprentice', in your Github account. Click on the <img class="inline" src="https://images.jointheleague.org/github/actions_menu.png">
menu item, then click on this big green button:

<img class="c400" src="https://images.jointheleague.org/github/understand_workflows.png" >

This will allow your repo to tell The League when you check in code ( using a GIthub action in the .github directory ) , so we can track your progress. If you aren't a League student, you can skip it. 

Now click on the <img class="inline" src="https://images.jointheleague.org/github/code_menu.png"> 
menu item to go back to the main page. 

### Create a new Codespace

Next, on the main repository page,  look for the  <img class="inline" src="https://images.jointheleague.org/github/code_button.png"> 
button. Click on the button, and after the window pops up,  click on the "Codespaces" tab. It will look like this: 

<img class="c400" src="https://images.jointheleague.org/module-navigation/create_codespace.png" >

Click on the "Create codespace on master"  button. A new tab or window will open, and
it will read that it is "Setting up your codespace". This may take a few
minutes. When it is done, you will have a Visual Studio Code window, which will look 
something like this: 

<img class = "c400" src="https://images.jointheleague.org/module-navigation/vscode.png">

You are ready to start your lessons. You editor window should be displaying the README file, and
at the bottom of that file it will tell you which lesson to start with, `lessons/lessons/00_Turtles/01_Get_Started.ipynb`
