        "\n",
        "The first program where you met Tina was  pretty complicatated! But it was made of a lot of simple parts. The next program is simpler, and has commands that you can figure out for yourself. In the next program, `02c_Squares_and_Circles`, Tina will draw a square and a circle. You task will be to read the program, figure out what it does, and change it. \n",
        "\n",
        "Here is what some of the program will look like: \n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "tina = turtle.Turtle()                  # Create a turtle named tina\n",

        "tina.pencolor('blue')                   # Set the pen color to blue\n",
        "tina.forward(200)                       # Move tina forward by the forward distance\n",
        "tina.right(90)                          # Turn tina left by the left turn\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "The program will have a lot of lines like this. Each line is a command for Tina to do something. The commands are in English, and they are pretty easy to understand. What you will do is: \n",
        "\n",
        "Run the program, then read through the program and figure out what each command does. The part of the program at the start of the line: \n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "tina.forward(200) \n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "is the command. What could this line do? Maybe ... move Tina forward by 200 steps?\n",
        "\n",
        "After that will be a comment, which looks like this: \n",
        "\n",

        "Comments are only for people to read, and they start with a `#`. They are there to help you understand the program.\n",

        "## Assignment\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Run the program `02c_Squares_and_Circles` and see what it does.\n",
        "2. Read through the program and figure out what each command does.\n",
        "3. Change the program so that Tina draws a square and a circle of different sizes and colors.\n",
        "4. Run the program again and see what it does now.\n",
