"""
The is a simple Turtle program that draws a square and writes a message. The
lines that start with a # are comments. They are not executed by Python. The
lines inside the three quotes are also comments, but of a different sort (
called "doc comments" ) Comments are used to explain what the code does. Read
the program and try to understand what each line does.

RUM ME! YOu can run this program by clicking on ▶️ icon ar the top of the editor
window.
