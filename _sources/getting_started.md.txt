# Getting Started

```{toctree}

gs_codespaces

```

To get started with this course, you will:

1. Create an account on [Github](https://github.com)
2. Make a copy of the source code repository for the lesson

## 1: Get a Github Account

Github is a professional source code repository, and almost everything you do at the League will involve Github. 

<a href="https://github.com/signup" target="_blank">Create an Account at Github</a>

If you already have an account, sign into it now. 


## 2: Get the Source Code

Click this button to create a codespace from the source code repository. This
operation will create a web IDE that you can use to complete the lessons --
Github Codespaces -- and after you check in your code with git, it will create a
copy of the whole repo in your Github account.

If you want to run an IDE on your local machine, rather than the web, see [Getting Started with an IDE](./gs_ide.md).
