# Getting Started

```{toctree}
:hidden:

gs_codespaces
gs_ide

```

To get started with this course, you will:

1. Create an account on [Github](https://github.com)
2. Make a copy of the source code repository for the lesson
3. Setup up your IDE ( Integrated Development Environment, your programming editor. ) 

## Get a Github Account

Github is a professional source code repository, and almost everything you do at the League will involve Github.

If you already have an account, sign into it now. 

## Get the Source Code and Setup your IDE

There are two different ways to do these steps: 

* The easier way is to do everything online, using [Github Codespaces](./gs_codespaces.md).
* The more flexible way is to install an [IDE on your local computer](./gs_ide.md).

We recommend most students start with [Getting Started with Codespaces](./gs_codespaces.md). 

### Selecting Codespaces 

You should use the Codespace if:
* You want to get started quickly
* You are working on a Chromebook computer
* Your computer is really slow but can run a web browser OK
* You will work on lessons from multiple computers

If these situations apply to use, follow the instructions for [Getting Started with Codespaces](./gs_codespaces.md).

### Selecting an IDE 

You can use a local IDE if:
* You can install software on your computer
* You have a recent, fast computer with at least 8G of memory
* You will mostly use only one computer. 
* You are OK with doing a bit more work. 
* You are working on games or graphics program and want them to run faster on a larger screen. 

If those statements sound like you, follow the instructions for [Getting Started with an IDE](./gs_ide.md).
