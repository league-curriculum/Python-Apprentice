# Getting Started

```{toctree}
:hidden:

gs_codespaces
gs_ide

```

To get started with this course, you will:

1. Create an account on [Github](https://github.com).
2. Tell us your Github name so we can track your progress.
3. Make a copy of the source code repository for the course.
4. Start the web-based programming editor to begin the course. 

## 1: Get a Github Account

Github is a professional source code repository, and almost everything you do at
the League will involve Github, so let's start with creating a Github account. 

<a href="https://github.com/signup" target="_blank">Create an Account at Github</a>

If you already have an account, sign into it now. 

## 2: Start your Codespace

Click the button below to start your Codespace online programming environment. 


<div class="centered" style="margin: 20px 0;">
<span class="button green"><a href="https://github.com/codespaces/new?template_repository=league-curriculum/Python-Apprentice" target="_blank" >
<img src="https://images.jointheleague.org/p3logos/github-mark-white.png" alt="Start the Class">
Start The Class</a></span>
</div>


Then, on the next page,   click on the green button:

## 3: Wait for the Server to Start

The first time your start the class, it will take a while for the codespace to build, but in a few
minutes you will have a new Python Apprentice class.
