# Getting Started

```{toctree}
:hidden:

gs_codespaces
gs_ide

```

To get started with this course, you will:

1. Create an account on [Github](https://github.com)
2. Make a copy of the source code repository for the lesson
3. Setup up your IDE ( Integrated Development Environment, your programming editor. ) 

## Get a Github Account

Github is a professional source code repository, and almost everything you do at the League will involve Github.

If you already have an account, sign into it now. 

## Get the Source Code

Click this button to create a codespace from the source code repository. This operation will create 
a web IDE that you can use to complete the lessions, and after you check in your code with git, 
it will create a copy of the whole repo in your Github account.

If you want to run an IDE on your local machine, rather than the web, see [Getting Started with an IDE](./gs_ide.md).
