# About Python Level 1

The League's Python Level 1 curriculum introduces students to the core feature
of Python using professional tools like Github and Visual Studio Code. The
course is aligned with the [PCEP™ – Certified Entry-Level Python Programmer](https://pythoninstitute.org/pcep) 
exam from the Python Institue, so students who have completed this course
will be familiar with all of material on the test.

## Stuff

```{note} Notes require **no** arguments, so content can start here.
( But, you could, right?)
```

```{caution} The is a caution
Cuidado baby
```

:::{note}
This is a tip, in a more markdowny format
:::

Since Pythagoras, we know that {math}`a^2 + b^2 = c^2`.

```{math}
:label: mymath
(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2

(a + b)^2  &=  (a + b)(a + b) \\
           &=  a^2 + 2ab + b^2
```

The equation {eq}`mymath` is a quadratic equation.

Alternately: 

$$
(a + b)^2  &=  (a + b)(a + b) \\
           &=  a^2 + 2ab + b^2
$$ (mymath2)

The equation {eq}`mymath2` is also a quadratic equation.
