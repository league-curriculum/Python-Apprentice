# About The Course

The League's Python Apprentice curriculum introduces students to the core feature
of Python using professional tools like Github and Visual Studio Code. The
course is aligned with the [PCEP™ – Certified Entry-Level Python Programmer](https://pythoninstitute.org/pcep) 
exam from the Python Institue, so students who have completed this course
will be familiar with all of material on the test.
